    <h5> Key Findings
        <li>From 2010 to 2020, the majority of fires occur during the fall season, from August to November.</li>
        <li>The primary factor influencing understory fire is fire size.</li>
        <li>The deforestation fire has the highest biomass value, the highest fire radiative power, and the longest fire persistence.</li>
        <li>The size of the fire has a minor impact on high fire confidence.</li>
        <li>Fire persistence has a significant impact on all types of fire confidence.</li>
        <li>From 2018 to 2019, the deforested area reached a decade high of 259,349 square kilometers. In other words, the rate of deforestation has increased by 34% in a year.</li>    
        <li>State Rondonia has the highest accumulated deforested area until the year 2020, accounting for 23 percent of its total.</li>   
        <li>In the year 2020, the Amazon rainforest has an estimated 230,679 fires occurred. And most of the fires happened in states Para and Maranhao. </li>  
        <li>The fire has spread to 93,096 square kilometers in the state of Mato Grosso. In 2020, this state had the most burning area compared to the other states.</li>
        <li>The states of Para and Mato Grosso have the most fires that last longer than three days.</li>
